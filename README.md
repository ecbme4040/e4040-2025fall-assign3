# Assignment 3  - distributed in GitHub Repo e4040-2025Fall-assign3

The assignment is distributed as several Jupyter notebooks and a number of directories and subdirectories in utils.

# Detailed instructions on how to submit this assignment/homework:

1. The assignment will be distributed as a Github classroom assignment - as a special repository accessed through a link
2. A student's copy of the assignment gets created automatically with a special name - <span style="color:red"><strong>students must rename per instructions below</strong></span>
3. The solution(s) to the assignment have to be submitted inside that repository as a set of "solved" Jupyter Notebooks, and several modified python files which reside in directories/subdirectories. This step is done by pushing all the files to the main branch.
4. Three files/screenshots need to be uploaded into the directory `figures/` which prove that the assignment has been done in the cloud.
5. Submit your repository through Gradescope.

# Code Ownership Declaration
We strongly encourage everyone to include a short code ownership note at the top of each .py file you submit.
It is a simple, professional way to acknowledge your own work and give credit if you discussed or referenced any materials.

This note is not graded, it is just good practice for academic and professional integrity.
You are free to adjust the wording as you like, as long as it reflects your contribution honestly.

Example format (feel free to adapt):
```python
# Author: [Your Name] 
# UNI: [Your UNI]
# Date: [Submission Date]
# Course: EECS E4040 - Deep Learning & Neural Networks
# Assignment: [Assignment Number or Title]

# Note: I wrote this code myself, except where I have clearly mentioned references or collaborations.

# If I collaborated or referred to external sources, I have listed them below:
# References / Collaborations:
# - [e.g., Discussion with John Doe on gradient clipping concept]
# - [e.g., Used numpy official documentation for array broadcasting]
```

Adding this short note helps us recognize your effort and keeps your work clearly documented.


## (Re)naming of the student repository (TODO students) 

INSTRUCTIONS for naming the student's solution repository for assignments with one student:
* This step will require changing the repository name
* Students MUST use the following name for the repository with their solutions: e4040-2025Fall-assign??-UNI (the first part "e4040-2025Fall-assign??" will probably be inherited from the assignment, so only UNI needs to be added) 
* Initially, the system will give the repo a name that ends with a  student's Github userid. The student MUST change that name and replace it with the name requested in the point above
* Good Example: e4040-2025Fall-assign??-zz9999;   Bad example: e4040-2025Fall-assign??-e4040-2025Fall-assign??-zz9999.
* This change can be done from the "Settings" tab which is located on the repo page.

INSTRUCTIONS for naming the students' solution repository for assignments with more students, such as the final project. Students need to use a 4-letter groupID: 
* Template: e4040-2025Fall-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3. -> Example: e4040-2025Fall-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000.


# Organization of this directory

TODO students: Run commands to create a directory tree, as described in previous assignments

For example, if we want to predict the value at time $t=6$, we should use data points from $t=0$ to $t=5$ as the input $X$ for the model. The target value, $y$, for this input sequence would then be the data point at $t=6$. Importantly, the lookback window (in this case, 6 data points) should always exclude the actual point we’re trying to predict. This ensures that the model is only using historical data to make its predictions, rather than information from the future.\n","\n","To implement this, we’ll create a function that generates a lookback dataset by passing a sliding window over the data. The length of this window, or \"lookback,\" determines how many data points are included in each sequence. Here, we’ll set the lookback to a default of 10, though this can be adjusted later when fine-tuning the model. For now, start with a lookback of 10 as a baseline.\n","\n","Before generating the lookback dataset, we also need to normalize the data (`open_prices`) to standardize the range of input values. To do this, perform a standard normalization by subtracting the mean of `open_prices` from each data point and then dividing by the standard deviation. This normalized data is then ready to be passed to the lookback function, which will create the dataset for training the model.\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"./img/lookback.png\" width=\"500\" class=\"center\"/>\n","</center>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d910a3e5-cff5-4b76-8977-c33ed8fa5df9","metadata":{"id":"d910a3e5-cff5-4b76-8977-c33ed8fa5df9"},"source":["<font color=\"red\"><strong>TODO:</strong></font> Normalize the data following the description above."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"f88f1a90-45f2-4a1a-9621-49df00043fe0","metadata":{"id":"f88f1a90-45f2-4a1a-9621-49df00043fe0"},"outputs":[],"source":["###################################################\n","# TODO: Set open_prices_normalized following the  #\n","#       description above.                        #\n","#                                                 #\n","###################################################\n","\n","open_prices_normalized = None\n","\n","###################################################\n","# ENDTODO #\n","###################################################"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"786d8e42-3092-439a-acfd-096dc9e6b8d3","metadata":{"id":"786d8e42-3092-439a-acfd-096dc9e6b8d3"},"source":["<font color=\"red\"><strong>TODO:</strong></font> Complete the `create_dataset` function following the description above."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"070a0a94","metadata":{"id":"070a0a94"},"outputs":[],"source":["def create_dataset(data, lookback = 10):\n","    X, y = [], []\n","    ###################################################\n","    # TODO: Create the lookback dataset following the #\n","    #       description above.                        #\n","    #                                                 #\n","    ###################################################\n","\n","\n","\n","    ###################################################\n","    # ENDTODO #\n","    ###################################################\n","\n","    return np.array(X), np.array(y)\n","\n","# Define the lookback period (You can change this later)\n","lookback = 10\n","\n","# Prepare the dataset with lookback\n","X, y = create_dataset(open_prices_normalized, lookback)\n","\n","\n","# If this was done correctly, the number of samples for X and y should be equal,\n","# X should also have the lookback number as the second dimension.\n","print(\"X_open_prices_lookback\", X.shape)\n","print(\"y_open_prices\", y.shape)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"13d39247","metadata":{"id":"13d39247"},"source":["## Split Data into Training, Validation, and Test (5%)\n","\n","By this point in your data science career, you have become familiar with good practice in splitting data\n","between training, validation, and testing.
